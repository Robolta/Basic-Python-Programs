**Libraries**
A big thing to keep in mind is that, while using libraries is important, offloading the bulk of an algorithm to a library in this repository defeats the purpose.
The goal here is to showcase the algorithms in Python, not just have a functional program.

**Variable Names**
Try to keep variable names descriptive rather than short.  I'd prefer `mean_squared_error` to `mse` given part of the goal is readability.  Comments are good, but ideally the code is readable enough on its own.

**Functions vs Classes**
I'd prefer a class that covers a handful of methods than a function with a 1-line calculation.  An example is the shape classes.  There would be many more unnecesary files if we had one for area, another for perimeter, another for the diagonal, etc.

**Pull Requests**
Generally, your pull requests are more likely to get attention if another person has commented with some feedback, but this doesn't mean I'll ignore ones without any.



**Unsure?**
As always, if you're unsure, the best thing you can do is ask.
